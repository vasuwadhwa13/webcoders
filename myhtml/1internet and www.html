            <p>A web server is a software application or hardware device that serves content to clients or end users over the internet.</p>
            <p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is responsible for accepting HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) requests from clients (such as web browsers), processing those requests, and returning HTTP responses containing the requested resources, such as HTML pages, images, files, or data.</li>
                <li>Every web server has an IP (Internet Protocol) address and possibly a domain name.</li>
                <li>Web servers implement various security mechanisms to protect against unauthorized access and cyberattacks.</li>
                <li>Upon receiving a request from the browser, the web server processes it, which may involve processing files, querying databases, or executing scripts to generate dynamic content.</li>
                <li>After processing the request, the web server constructs an HTTP response containing the requested content and sends it back to the client.</li>
                <li>Web servers can serve static content directly from files (such as HTML, CSS, and image files) or generate dynamic content by executing server-side scripts to produce HTML dynamically.</li>
                <li>Web servers handle multiple client connections simultaneously, managing resources efficiently to serve content to multiple clients concurrently.</li>
                <li>Popular web server software includes Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), etc. These servers are widely used to host websites, web applications, and other online services.</li>
